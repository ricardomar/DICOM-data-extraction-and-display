## Objectives:

- To develop a software tool that browses a DICOMDIR and lists the imagetype exams. When a image type exam is selected, the related directory record attributes are displayed. The user can visualize the sequence of images of the exam that was selected.


## Outputs:

- Software tool (with user interface) programmed in JAVA. The source code and documentation of the application is available here.

- Videos demonstrating the software tool in operation are presented next:
